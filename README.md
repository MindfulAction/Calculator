# Calculator
Calculator capable of simple arithmetic

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

DESCRIPTION:
This calculator is capable of simple arithmetic such ass addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Vanilla versions of HTML, CSS, and Javascript were
used for the purpose of reinforcing some fundamentals I had just recently studied. 

One of the challenges I faced during this project was creating the logic used to determine if a user input was a result of a "click" event or "keydown" event. 
Another one was properly storing and modifying the user input depending on whether or not the "CLEAR", which clears all of the input memory, or "Back<-", which 
deletes the last number input, was used in the middle of an operation (ie the user had already entered a first number and operator "5 + "). 

Some time in the future, I hope to clean up the code a bit by creating more "helper" functions that will overall improve the readability of the code. This is something I plan on focusing on going forward with future projects.
